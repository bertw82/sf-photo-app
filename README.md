# San Francisco Photo App

I created this project to showcase a gallery of pictures from a recent trip to San Francisco. I created this project using React and Create-React-App and depolyed it to Netlify [at this URL](https://sf-photo-app-f570b9.netlify.app).

This project features a paginated photo gallery that gets pictures from my Flickr account through the Flickr API. There is also a video on the home page of riding one of the famous Cable Cars in San Francisco. 

This React app passes the React Testing Library test that comes with Create-React-App.

I have deployed this app on Netlify with the use of Netlify Functions and an `.env` file in order to protect my API key from being exposed.
